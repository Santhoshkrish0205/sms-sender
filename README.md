# sms-sender
This code is a Python script that uses the Twilio API to send SMS messages. It prompts the user to enter a phone number and a message, and then it uses the Twilio REST client to send the SMS. The Twilio account SID and authentication token need to be provided for authentication.

The code defines a function `send_sms` that takes a phone number and a message as parameters. Inside the function, it initializes the Twilio client using the account SID and authentication token. It then tries to send the SMS by calling the `create` method on the `client.messages` object. If the SMS is sent successfully, it prints a success message along with the message SID. If an error occurs during the sending process, it prints the error message.

The `main` function is responsible for taking user input for the phone number and message, and it calls the `send_sms` function with those inputs.

To use this code, you need to have a Twilio account and provide the correct account SID and authentication token. Additionally, you need to have the `twilio` library installed in your Python environment.

It would be helpful to provide more context about the purpose or specific use case for the code in the GitHub repository description.
